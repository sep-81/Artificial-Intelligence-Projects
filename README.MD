## Projects

### CA0 - Introduction to AI

This project is an introduction to AI and Jupyter Notebooks. We should predict whether a passenger will survive the Titanic disaster.

### CA1 - Search

In this projects, the following search algorithms are implemented:

* BFS
* DFS and IDS
* A*
* Weighted A*

### CA2 - Genetics & Mini-Max

In this project, we implement an equation builder using genetic algorithms. And we implement a `Sim` game, and try to win using `Mini-Max` algorithm. The pruning technique is used to improve the performance.

### CA3 - Naive Bayes

This project is an implementation of Naive Bayes algorithm to classify the news into 4 categories.

### CA4 - Machine Learning

In this project, we implement the following classifiers to predict whether a person has diabetes or not:

* KNN
* Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression

`Random Forest` is also implemented as the optimal classifier. `GridSearchCV` is used to find the best parameters for the classifiers.

### CA5 - Neural Networks

This project has two parts:

#### Part 1

In this part, we implement a neural network from scratch to classify the Arabic letters. The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mloey1/ahcd1).

#### Part 2

In this part, wwe use `TensorFlow` library and `Keras` API to implement a neural network to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset is available [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
